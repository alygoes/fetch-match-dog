## About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can see a live version of this app at: [https://alygoes.github.io/fetch-match-dog/](https://alygoes.github.io/fetch-match-dog/)

## Future Development

My next features would be:

-Login page:
    1. Validate the email field as an email type
    2. Prevent users from submitting to the login endpoint if either field is empty and provide that feedback
    3. Provide users with an error on login fails
-Dog search features
    1. Displaying dog city and state instead of zip
    2. Provide more sort and filter options: distance from location, age
    3. Filtering as a left sidebar (like petfinder)
-Other
    1. A logout link
    2. Test every component
    3. A view for all your favorite dogs
    4. Save favorites, maybe in local storage 
    5. Session is ending warning/extend session option (since cookie lasts 1 hour)
    6. Enter key event listeners
    7. A view for your dog match
